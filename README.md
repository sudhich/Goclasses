Let’s analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Observations:
- **Decision Boundary 1 (DB1):**  
  The boundary is more complex, tightly hugging the data points. This behavior aligns with **1-NN**, as 1-NN classifiers tend to overfit and create decision boundaries around individual points.

- **Decision Boundary 2 (DB2):**  
  The boundary is smoother and less complex. This behavior aligns with **3-NN**, where more neighbors are considered, leading to more generalized decision boundaries.

### Evaluating the Statements:
1. **DB1 belongs to 3-NN while DB2 belongs to 1-NN.**  
   **False**. DB1 is associated with 1-NN, and DB2 is associated with 3-NN.

2. **DB1 belongs to 1-NN while DB2 belongs to 3-NN.**  
   **True**. As explained above, DB1 corresponds to 1-NN (complex boundary), and DB2 corresponds to 3-NN (smooth boundary).

3. **DB1 gives zero test error.**  
   **False**. DB1 gives zero **training error** because 1-NN memorizes the training data perfectly. However, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee zero test error due to overfitting.

4. **DB1 gives zero training error.**  
   **True**. 1-NN always gives zero training error because it correctly classifies all training points.

### Correct Option:
**B. False, True, False, True**
